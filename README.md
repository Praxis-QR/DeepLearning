This repository contains Jupyter ( or rather Google Colab) notebooks that contain demo codes used in the book [Deep Learning for Business Manager](https://aidl4managers.blogspot.com/p/home.html) which is used as a textbook in course Foundations of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence at [Praxis Business School](http://www.praxis.ac.in). The codes for the different chapters are organised as follows :
- Chapter 0 : The AI Winter, no code
- Chapter 1 : Intro to Neural Networks, no code
- Chapter 2 : [Basic Feedforward Neural Network](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_2_Neural_Networks.ipynb) that teaches a machine to multiply.
- Chapter 3 : [Modification of previous model](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_3_Under_the_Hood.ipynb) that demonstrates different parameters.
- Chapter 4 : [Medical Diagnostics](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_4_Medical_Prediction.ipynb) as an example of a real use of neural network.
- Chapter 5 : [Convulational Neural Network](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_5_CNN_Image_Classification.ipynb) that demonstrates Image Recognition or Classification using the CIFAR dataset
- Chapter 6 : Recurrent Neural Networks for predictive typing
  - [Prediction of next CHARACTER](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_6A_RNN_predictive_typing_Characters.ipynb)
  - [Prediction of next WORD](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_6B_RNN_predictive_typing_Words.ipynb)
- Chapter 7 : Reinforcement Learning 
  - [Self Driving Taxi](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_7A_Reinforcement_Learning_TaxiV3_v1.ipynb)
  - [Lunar Lander](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_7B_Reinforcement_Learning_LunarLander_v2_DQN_v2.ipynb)
- Chapter 8 : Generative Adversarial Networks that learns [How to write numbers](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Chapter_8_GAN.ipynb) 
- Chapter 9 : Carbon and Silicon. Only philosophy, no code!<br><br>
There is also a very basic [Notebook](https://github.com/Praxis-QR/DeepLearning/blob/main/AI_DL_Starter.ipynb) to get absolute newbies started on Google Colab. There are better tutorials on Colab are available but this notebook is just for the sake of completeness.
